This project contains solutions for the problems described in the "Coding Interviews. Questions, analysis, solutions" by Harry He.

These solutions are in no way complete or optimal, as I wanted to resolve all of them first and in quick time.

I used the dummy package structure, as I wanted every file to be served as single one without any need of additional 
packages, and using the same class names. So it contains repeated copy-pasted code in every class, but you can run it 
as a single file without caring too much about classpath. Maybe it will be organized better some day, most likely not.
